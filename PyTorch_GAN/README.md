This folder contains the notebook and the generated ```.pkl``` files. 

The notebook ```PyTorch_GAN``` can be executed to create and train a model on the MNIST dataset.

The file ```train_samples``` contains images that were generated by the generator while training. This can be used to illustrates how the model's performance improved over time.

The file ```generator``` contains our pretrained model. This file is to be loaded for further use.
